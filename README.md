## Getting Started

Trying out Java on VS Code for the first time (I'll admit this is a template, which I modified as per my liking, plus I have OOP in this language as one of my uni-courses, so as I go further and further, will build future projects and commit, stage, update and publish accordingly. Cheers, let me sip on my 6th cup of coffee.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

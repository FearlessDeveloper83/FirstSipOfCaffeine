## Getting Started

This is my first time setting up and experimenting with **Java in VS Code**. I started with the default Java project template and then modified it slightly to understand how things work under the hood.

Java is one of my core subjects this semester, especially for **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, so this repository will grow as I learn new concepts. Over time, I plan to build small programs, mini-projects, and practice exercises, and regularly **commit, stage, update, and publish** my progress using Git.

This project is mainly for learning, experimentation, and building a strong foundation in Java development.

## Folder Structure

The workspace follows a simple structure that is easy to understand for beginners:

- `src` — contains all the Java source code files (`.java`)
- `lib` — used for external libraries or dependencies (if required later)

When the program is compiled, the output files (`.class`) are automatically generated inside the `bin` folder.

This structure helps keep source code and compiled files organized and separate, which is useful as projects become larger.

> If needed, the folder structure can be customized by editing the `.vscode/settings.json` file.

## Dependency Management

VS Code provides a **JAVA PROJECTS** panel that helps manage libraries and dependencies in a visual way. As a beginner, this makes it easier to add or remove dependencies without manually configuring everything.

This setup serves as a starting point for my journey as a first-year student developer and will evolve as I progress through my coursework and gain more hands-on experience.
